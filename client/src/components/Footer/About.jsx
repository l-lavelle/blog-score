        <h3 className='mt-3'>Creation of this Site</h3>
        <p>Hi my name is Lauren Lavelle the lead developer for Blog Score. This site began as a collaborative effort between full stack developers to create a user friendly and scalable application. We wanted a place where tech lovers could stay up to date on all the new things coming out. I wanted to continue building the site with more capabilities to create a great user experience. Continuing to try new skills and implement new technologies and libraries to build this site has taught me a lot and helped hone my skills. I hope all of you enjoy the platform and are excited to try something new! I know for me the best way to learn tech is through building something new. </p>
