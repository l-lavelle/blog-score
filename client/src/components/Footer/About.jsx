        <h3>Creation of this Site</h3>
        <p>Hi my name is Lauren Lavelle the lead developer for Blog Score. This site began as a collaborative effort between full stack developers to create a user friendly and scalable application. We wanted a place where tech lovers could stay up to date on all the new things coming out. I wanted to continue building the site with more capabilities to create a great user experience.

        <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
        <p>Are curious to see what technologies were used to build this site? This application was created using the MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) stack. 
Looking at backend, data is stored using the NoSQL database MongoDb using Mongoose an object data modeling library to create model schemas. GraphQL, a query language, is used to get data from the database. Authentication and authorization is setup using JSON (JWT) Web Tokens. The front end of the application is comprised of components written using React.
